# Max-min-and-mean-calculator

My first time creating a project using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript!

# Purpose

It allows users to input 3 numbers and with each different button allows the user to calculate the max, min, mean, median, and range.

# Challenges

Since it was my first time creating something like this, the website is not very responsive nor does it look very aesthetically pleasing.
